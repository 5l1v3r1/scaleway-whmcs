# scaleway-whmcs
A WHMCS Module for automatically provisioning Cloud and VPS Servers provided by Scaleway

Tested with WHMCS v6 but it should be fine with version 7 too.

This is a BETA version and it's not recommended to use it on production servers before rigorous tests! 

More specifically, this module allow you to resell Scaleway servers, without manually work!
